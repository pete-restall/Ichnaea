			<h1>Page Description</h1>
			<p>
				This page has been generated by the AccountAdministrationService.OpenAccount() method after Opening a new Account.
			</p>
			<p>
				The AccountFactory class has been used to create a new Account Aggregate Root and tell Ichnaea to track it.  Until the Account has been
				added to a Repository all tracking is done in memory and not persisted.  Note the term 'add' as opposed to 'insert' or 'create' - the
				Repository is conveying collection semantics, not persistence semantics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once added to a Repository, an Aggregate Root's in-memory and future Domain Events will be sent to the persistent store - in this case an
				NEventStore Event Stream.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to Opening an Account a Surrogate ID is also generated - passing sensitive information such as Sort Code and Account Number,
				which constitute the ID in the model, would not be acceptable in a real application.  Since the Surrogate ID is outside of the Domain
				Model in this application it is simply created as a regular RavenDB Document.
